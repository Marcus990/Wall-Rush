# Wall Rush - Interactive Multiplayer Experience
Wall Rush is an interactive and engaging game application with approximately 500 player visits built on the Roblox Studio platform using Lua as the main programming language. The game is themed around the concept of a moving wall that the player must avoid while trying to collect coins and avoid other obstacles. There are multiple levels throughout the game that the player must complete in order to finish the game.

With hundreds of created models as well as numerous advanced features to further enhance the game experience such as a Datastore that saves player data after they leave the game, an in-game shop where players can customize their avatar, a monetized game pass shop using Roblox's Marketplace Service that generated revenue from the game, a quest system, and an updated leaderboard that displays and compares live player stats, players are able to fully immerse themselves in my game all while having fun!
